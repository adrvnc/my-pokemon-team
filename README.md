## My Process
### Built with 

- React 18.2.0
- Tachyons  
- CSS 
- PokéAPI 
### What I've learned 

- The ``useState`` hook sets up and manages state variables. 
- ``useEffect`` hooks are used to fetch data from an API. Its general-purpose is to manage side effects like requesting data from an API and rendering or updating the user interface (UI). 
- ``setState`` will update our state variables with new data. For the purposes of this project, ``setState`` will update the state variable with our JSON response data and display data for all of the Pokémon fetched from the PokéApi in our app's user interface.
## Useful Resources 
- [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/) - This is a free API used for this project. Recommeneded for learning how to create an application using an API.
