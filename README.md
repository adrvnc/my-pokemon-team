## My Process
### Built with 

- React 18.2.0
- Tachyons  
- CSS 
- PokéAPI 
### What I've learned 

- API Integration: I successfully integrated the PokéAPI into my ReactJS project to fetch data dynamically. This allowed me to retrieve information about specific Pokemon, such as their names, sprites, and types, and display them in the browser. I learned how to make asynchronous API calls and handle the responses appropriately.

- Data Mapping and Rendering: I used the array mapping technique in ReactJS to iterate over the fetched data from the PokéAPI. By mapping over the Pokemon data, I was able to dynamically generate components and display relevant information, such as the Pokemon's name, sprite, and type. This helped me understand how to render lists of data efficiently and dynamically update the UI based on the available data.
## Useful Resources 
- [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/) - This is a free API used for this project. Recommeneded for learning how to create an application using an API.
